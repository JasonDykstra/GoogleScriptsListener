A Google Script that interacts with an IOS Shortcut to update my climbing spreadsheet

I got tired of manually going on my climbing tracking spreadsheet and changing the background color of the current date every time I worked out, so I made this script. This script interacts with a shortcut on my phone and will automatically update the spreadsheet for me depending on what input(s) I give the shortcut on my phone!
