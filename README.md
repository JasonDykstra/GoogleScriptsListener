# GoogleScriptsListeners

I got tired of manually going on my climbing tracking spreadsheet and changing the background color of the current date every time I worked out, so I made a script. The script interacts with a shortcut on my phone and will automatically update the spreadsheet for me depending on what input(s) I give the shortcut on my phone!

I got a little carried away and made scripts for a few more spreadsheets as well, so this is where I collectively store them :)
